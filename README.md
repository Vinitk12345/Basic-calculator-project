# Basic-calculator-project
ðŸš€ Excited to share my Basic Calculator project in Python! It performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division using traditional functions and lambda functions. The project focuses on error handling (like division by zero) and user interaction. Check it out for insights on modular coding and function implementation!
